# SmartClaim-AI #

The AI-Powered Medical Claim Processing System is designed to automate the extraction and classification of key information from medical invoices. Users can upload invoice images or PDFs, and the system will extract patient details, provider details, claim data, and insurance information using AI. The extracted data is then stored in a secure database for easy retrieval and management.

This system is built as a user-only platform where authenticated users can submit and manage their claims. The AI-powered extraction process is integrated at the backend using AWS Textract.

Features:

✔️ User Authentication – Secure login and signup 

✔️ Medical Invoice Upload – Upload  images of invoices

✔️ AI-Based Data Extraction – Automatic extraction of key claim details

✔️ User Dashboard – View and manage claims

✔️ MongoDB Storage – Store claim data securely

✔️ Supabase for Storage – Store and retrieve uploaded files
